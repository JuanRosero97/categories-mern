# Intro

In this project I built a RESTful API in Node.js using express.js and MongoDB. I designed a database where CRUD can be made thanks to an identification _id, however, in future projects I plan to design the React component to include different products in each category and carry out an inventory of them. And finally I will include a Registration and Login page. In this case use Material Ui for the FRONT-END design.

## Screenshots

* Main page. Displays the categories added to the database.

* When you click into the edit category, open "addCategory" page sending the category id by URL, and appears a Toast if the transaction was successful.

 * When you click on "añadir Categoria", it opens the "addCategory" page consisting of the text fields, a color selector and the "añadir" button. A toast appears if the transaction was successful.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Example:  
Clone this repository. You will need `MongoDB Community Server`, `Express.js`, `React` and `Node.js` installed globally on your machine.  

## Installation:

`npm install`  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000/Categories] to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run start-build-server`

If you need to make changes,  builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
Open [http://localhost:5000/Categories] to view it in the browser. 

### `npm run start-react`

Runs the app in the client mode for view the React Components without the server and database.
Open [http://localhost:3000/Categories] to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\

## About me

My name is Juan Rosero, I am an engineer and I have always liked development and programming, and I like different fields of study, in the vast majority of them I am empirical, but I like to solve problems in the shortest time and with the best quality.
